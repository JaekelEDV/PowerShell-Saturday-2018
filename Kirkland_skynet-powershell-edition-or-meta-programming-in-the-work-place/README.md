# Skynet PowerShell Edition - Or Meta Programming In the Workplace

First off I have to talk about the name of my talk, Little John and I were hanging out one night and I had given him my talk abstract/description but no talk name. So in his infinite wisdom that night he came up with the name of Skynet, I just rolled with the name of thought it was funny.

The purpose of this talk is to you ways in which we do _Meta Programming_, Meta Programming is more of a technique then a specific language.
